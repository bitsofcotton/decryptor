# Description
If there's a turing-complete program byte array, we can redefine them as simple pmpu mnemonic set on finite memory finite register computer. (simple pmpu is also turing-complete.)
So with maximum set of operators and some status condition, we can approximate non general protection fault mnemonic set from byte array without caching nor so on.
