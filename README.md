# Description
If there's a turing-complete program byte array, we can redefine them as simple pmpu mnemonic set on finite memory finite register computer. (simple pmpu is also turing-complete.)
So with maximum set of operators and some status condition, we can approximate non general protection fault mnemonic set from byte array without caching nor so on if input is pure function and/or call/in/out to external space.

We target input argument as mnemonic set size, extra cpu inner status size, possible memory range relative/absolute, then, we want to get possible mnemonic set array.
But it is so far from the bases we have now.
